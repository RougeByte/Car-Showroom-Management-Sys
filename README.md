This is a JAVA console based Car Showroom Management which can be used to manage the Car Showroom Details such as information about Cars & Details of Employees.
This project uses the concepts of OOPS in JAVA such as classes & object, interfacing, inheritance...
After Executing the Mains file you would see an interface that Gives you Options To 1]Add Showroom, 2]Add Cars, 3]Add Employees, 4]Get Showroom, 5] Get Cars, 6] Get Employees.
It also uses get & set method() to get the information provide by the user & at the same the user can see the information that he had put in.
It is a basic project done by me to test my learning of OOPS concept in JAVA, Share this project to your friends and colleague to help them learn that how the concept of OOPS are helpful in building Projects.
